# Classical ML Feature-Pipeline Audit — Version 1.0

## Decision

**PASS**. This audit was completed after deterministic train/validation feature extraction and train-only preprocessing fit, and before any candidate estimator training.

## Frozen provenance

- ML specification SHA-256: `0d220564335a85e6fe3a193e212d68aec2abbf7744a23f267ba4390b428d6897`
- Feature registry SHA-256: `b515b9f81e8284281dc7bddfcc2b32e9655d09fce71d8aed998b8687f7840d3d`
- Registered pre-encoding features: 147
- Transformed columns after train-fit one-hot encoding: 265

## Leakage and fit-scope checks

- Model-visible snapshot access audit: PASS
- Train registry/order exact: True
- Validation registry/order exact: True
- Preprocessing fit scope: train only
- Validation handling: transform only, no refit
- Forbidden feature-name hits: none
- High-cardinality categorical fields (>100 train values): none
- Numeric features with absolute one-vs-rest train correlation >0.95: ['vendor_name_token_count', 'duplicate_exact_reference_count', 'payment_allocated_rel_diff', 'missing_vendor']

Strong association is reported for auditability and does not by itself establish leakage. Every feature remains governed by the already frozen source-lineage registry; no feature was added, removed, or revised after this audit.

## Distribution checks

- Constant train features: ['approval_missing_employee_actor_count', 'invoice_po_tax_abs_diff', 'invoice_po_shipping_abs_diff', 'gl_balance_abs_diff', 'missing_po', 'missing_employee', 'missing_reference', 'missing_currency', 'missing_amount', 'missing_invoice_lines', 'missing_po_lines']
- Near-constant train features (>=99% one value): ['approval_missing_employee_actor_count', 'gl_balance_abs_diff', 'missing_po', 'missing_employee', 'missing_reference', 'missing_currency', 'missing_amount', 'missing_invoice_lines', 'missing_po_lines']
- Per-feature missing rates, cardinalities, and correlation flags are saved in `feature_audit.csv` in the immutable run directory.

## Conclusion

No material feature-pipeline leakage or registry mismatch was detected.

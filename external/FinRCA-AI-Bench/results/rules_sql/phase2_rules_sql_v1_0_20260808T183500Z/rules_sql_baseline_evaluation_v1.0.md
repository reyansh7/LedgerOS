# Rules/SQL Baseline Evaluation — Version 1.0

## 1. Executive summary

The frozen deterministic baseline implemented all 15 registered rules and evaluated 439 held-out test cases. Exact 16-class accuracy was 0.849658; binary anomaly F1 was 0.980066. No learned model, LLM, API, or external service was used.

## 2. Frozen-spec provenance

- Specification: `docs/frozen_rules_sql_baseline_spec_v1.0.md`
- SHA-256: `0ee3192dd760dd2521791ef46543c9c7337cc6d8eff0f3cd4a7cba9e5d645675`
- Checksum verification: PASS
- Specification version: 1.0

## 3. Implementation architecture

The implementation uses CPython standard-library CSV parsing, strict `Decimal` arithmetic, deterministic Unicode/date normalization, in-memory relational indexes, explicit rule traces, tri-state aggregation, automated evidence-contract checks, and frozen single-label precedence. Every scored anomaly is traceable to `RSQL_F01_V1`–`RSQL_F15_V1`.

## 4. Dataset and evaluation setup

- Dataset version: `FinRCA-Bench v1 seed 42`
- Model-visible snapshot SHA-256: `d8dcd68290524db221bf07f5f654e4b930a039efb3f6ecabd98aa6e38eb7c662`
- Validation split: `data/benchmark/validation/case_ids.txt`
- Test split: `data/benchmark/test/case_ids.txt`
- Observation cutoff: `2026-06-30`
- Test cases: 439

## 5. F01 validation procedure and selected parameters

The frozen 3×4 grid was evaluated on validation only. The objective was macro-F1 over all 16 output classes; ties used higher similarity, then shorter window, then the initial value.

- Selected date window: 7 days
- Selected similarity: 1.00
- Validation macro-F1: 0.968053
- Objective ties: 12
- Decision: Selected similarity 1.00 and window 7 by the frozen objective/tie-break ordering.

Classification correctness and evidence correctness are separate. Evidence ID precision/recall compare returned primary-key tokens with benchmark evidence IDs; anti-join evidence is assessed by the frozen internal contract and snapshot-completeness checks.

## 11. Tri-state analysis

Overall state frequencies: `{"ANOMALY": 307, "INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE": 50, "MATCH": 82}`. Detailed failure-type, tier, and exact-hop state counts are saved in `tri_state.json`.

## 13. Error analysis

There were 66 exact-label errors. Primary error-category aggregates are:

| failure_type | tier | hop_count | error_category | count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F06_INVOICE_PAID_TWICE | 3 | 2 | COLLISION_OR_PRECEDENCE | 2 |
| F12_ERP_PAYMENT_MISSING_FROM_BANK | 2 | 1 | COLLISION_OR_PRECEDENCE | 2 |
| NO_FAILURE |  |  | FALSE_POSITIVE | 12 |
| NO_FAILURE |  |  | MISSING_EVIDENCE | 50 |

The case-level taxonomy, secondary causes, expected-rule trace status, and deterministic selected reason are saved in `error_analysis.csv`.

## 14. Known deterministic-baseline limitations

The implementation retains the specification's frozen limitations: reference-based duplicates; no receipt, amendment, alias, hierarchy, FX-rate, historical approval-policy, or holiday tables; exact chart-of-account assumptions; payment-level bank references; unique two-cycle-only F15 matching; and single-label precedence. These are descriptive limitations, not post-test rule changes.

## 15. Protocol deviations

NO PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS

One non-blocking implementation issue was recorded: F02's required-field bullet omits `invoice_total` while its explicit detection rule requires excluding nonpositive invoices. The implementation reads `invoice_total` solely for that frozen exclusion and does not alter F02 semantics.

## 16. Reproducibility instructions

From the repository root with Python 3.11+ and requirements installed, run:

```bash
python3 -m src.rules_sql.cli run --data-root data/benchmark --output-root results/rules_sql --run-id <new_unique_run_id>
```

Use a new run ID because run directories and raw predictions are immutable. Materially identical predictions and aggregate metrics are expected for the same dataset snapshot and environment; latency can vary.

## 17. Final conclusion

All 15 frozen rules were executable against the released schema. The measured results above characterize only this deterministic Rules/SQL baseline. No claim about any unevaluated method is made.
